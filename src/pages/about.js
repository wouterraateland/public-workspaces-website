    <h1>Public Workspaces, a 24 hour story</h1>
    <p>
      From time to time we like to work from outside of home. Trying to find
      suitable places herefor online, wasn't successful. This had to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day we decided to spend 24 hours to build our own startup, that would
      tackle this problem... And here we are now. Public Workspaces is a
      collaboration between visitors and possibilities created by workspace
      owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main goal of Public Workspaces is to offer both workers a great
      experience working in public spaces and to offer public workspace the
      exposure they deserve.
    </p>
    <h2>Current status</h2>
    <p>
      At this moment, information on public spaces in Delft is becoming
      available. Next, we will launch in more cities in the Netherlands!
    </p>
