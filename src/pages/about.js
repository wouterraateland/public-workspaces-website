    <h1>Public Workspaces, a 24 hour story</h1>
    <p>
      From time to time we like to work from outside of home. Trying to find
      suitable places herefor online, wasn't successful. This had to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day we decided to spend 24 hours to build our own startup, that would
      tackle this problem... And here we are now. Public Workspaces is a
      collaboration between visitors and possibilities created by workspace
      owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main goal of Public Workspaces is to offer both workers a great
      experience working in public spaces and to offer public workspace the
      exposure they deserve.
    </p>
    <h2>Current status</h2>
    <p>
      At this moment, the index page contains some placeholders containing data
      we gathered ourselves. Information on public spaces in Delft is becoming
      available quickly. Other cities will follow when we are established in
      Delft.
