    <h1>Public Workspaces, a 24 hour story</h1>
    <p>
      From time to time we like to work from outside of home. Trying to find
      suitable places online, wasn't successful. This had to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day we decided to spend 24 hours to build our own startup, that would
      tackle this problem... And here we are now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public Workspaces is a collaboration between visitors and possibilities
      created by workspace owners. The main goal of Public Workspaces is to
      offer both workers a great experience working in public spaces and to
      offer public workspaces the exposure they deserve.
    </p>
    <h2>Current status</h2>
    <p>
      At this moment, we have gathered around 40 public workspaces in Delft and
      are testing the reception of the website. If the test is successful, other
      cities will follow quickly!
